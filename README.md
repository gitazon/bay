# Gitazon-bay: Developer-to-Developer Trade Zone

Gitazon Bay is an online trading platform for developers only. You can imagine this is _eBay for developers_ (aw man, I hate to be a clone, and I'm not a clone)

### Everyone: But why????
Github has become a kind of social network just for developers, since it's a social network, there are a lot of developers visit every day. So why not do something more than just code? 

Every developer has his own storage house which full of awesome technology stuff. Why waste it since you don't need it anymore? Why post it to Craiglist or eBay, where everybody selling everything, and you can't believe anyone?

### Buyer: So we can trust Github users (the sellers)?

Yeah... I mean, some of them. You have to choose wisely when you buying stuff online. Since Github is a social network for developers, many serious developer has came here to build their repoputation, nobody want to waste his repoputation just to scam. I'm not telling you trust all of the people on Github, but you can see his Github profile to determine if you should trust him or not. 

### Seller: How can I sell my stuff on Github?

Glad you asked. Just open a new [Issue](https://github.com/gitazon/bay/issues), pick some label to make it easier to search, put some interesting title and don't forget to tell us about your item in the description, REAL image is a must, we're developers, we're not fool, we smart enough to see if it's a real image or just a Googled one.

### Buyer: How can I search for things I want to buy?
